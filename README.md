# TLSv1.2 Requirement

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council has [mandated](http://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls) that early versions of TLS be retired from service.  All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, PayPal is updating its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections. At this time, PayPal will also require HTTP/1.1 for all connections.

You may find more official relevant information at the [PayPal Technical Support website](https://www.paypal-techsupport.com):

## What does this mean for PayPal merchants?

Merchants should verify that all of their systems are capable of using the TLSv1.2 protocol with a SHA-256 certificate. In most cases this means ensuring that you are up to date with security updates, including current versions of operating systems, encryption libraries, and runtime environments.

PayPal is making this upgrade alongside the rest of the payments industry. **All credit card processors must make these changes** by the PCI deadline, so you should expect to see similar announcements from other payment providers you might use.

To help merchants get started, we've put together a few notes for common environments. These checks assume that you have installed all the libraries required by the PayPal REST SDKs. For these checks to be valid, they must be run on a production system or one that *exactly* matches the configuration you have in production.

### Java

* The TLS version can be set via [`SSLContext`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html).
* **The latest Java (currently 8) is preferred.** In Java 8, TLSv1.2 is used by default when a TLS version is not specified.

Java version | TLSv1.2 support
--- | ---
5 and earlier | No support.
6 | Available. TLSv1.2 must be explicitly enabled. Requires at least [Oracle Java version `6u115`](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/overview-156328.html) or [IBM V6 service refresh 10](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.60.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/overrideSSLprotocol.html).  A [PayPal SDK update](#paypal-java-sdk-support) or code change may be required.
7 | Available. TLSv1.2 must be explicitly enabled. A [PayPal SDK update](#paypal-java-sdk-support) or code change may be required.
8 | Default. TLSv1.2 is enabled by default. No code change is required, though it is always recommended to make sure you're using the latest [PayPal SDK](#paypal-java-sdk-support).

To check Java, first verify that Java runtime 6 or higher is installed by running `java -version` from command line. If you have Java 5 or below, please upgrade it first. Then download [the provided test application](java). And in a shell on your **production system**, run:
`> java -jar TlsCheck.jar`

- On success, `PayPal_Connection_OK` is printed.
- On failure a networking exception will be thrown.

[legacy (merchant 1.x)](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Legacy-Java-SDK/) | [1.1.0](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Legacy-Java-SDK/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

### .NET

The .NET 4.5 (or greater) runtime must be installed for TLSv1.2 to be enabled.
  * The TLS version can be set via [`ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.securityprotocoltype(v=vs.110).aspx).

To check .NET, first verify you have .NET framework 4.5 or higher by running [NetFrameworkVersions](net/NetFrameworkVersions) on the console of your production system. If you do not have .NET 4.5 or above, please upgrade it first. 

Then, run [TlsCheck](net/TlsCheck) in a shell on your **production system**:
`> TlsCheck.exe`

- On success, `PayPal_Connection_OK` is printed.

#### PayPal .NET SDK support

SDK | TLSv1.2 support version
--- | -------
[REST NET-SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-NET-SDK) | [1.7.3](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-NET-SDK/releases)
[sdk-core](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-core-dotnet) | [1.7.1](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-core-dotnet/releases)

### PHP

PHP uses the system supplied CURL library. OpenSSL used by CURL library is required to be 1.0.1c or higher. You may also need to update your SSL/TLS libraries, see [here](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/ssl-compared.html) for more details.

To check PHP, in a shell on your **production system**, run:

`$ php -r '$ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "https://tlstest.paypal.com/"); var_dump(curl_exec($ch));'`

- On success, `PayPal_Connection_OK` is printed.
- On failure, `bool(false)` will be printed.

You can get the specific error with `curl_error($ch)`:

`php -r '$ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "https://tlstest.paypal.com/"); var_dump(curl_exec($ch)); var_dump(curl_error($ch));'`

> **Note:** Please make sure that your command line test is using the same versions of PHP & SSL/TLS libraries as your web server
> **Note:** If you are using MAMP or XAMPP as your development setup, currently the PHP packaged with them comes with a lower version of OpenSSL, which currently cannot be updated easily. You can find more information on this issue and find a temporary workaround [here](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK/issues/484#issuecomment-176240130)

### Python

Python uses the system supplied OpenSSL. TLSv1.2 requires OpenSSL 1.0.1c or higher.

To check Python, in a shell on your **production system**, run: 

For Python 2.x:

`$ python -c "import urllib2; print(urllib2.urlopen('https://tlstest.paypal.com/').read())"`

For Python 3.x:

`$ python -c "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('https://tlstest.paypal.com/').read())"`

- On success, `PayPal_Connection_OK` is printed.
- On failure, an `URLError` will be raised: <br/>
`urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:590)>`
`urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 54] Connection reset by peer>`

### Ruby

Ruby 2.0.0 or above is required to use the TLSv1.2 capability of the system supplied OpenSSL. OpenSSL 1.0.1c is the first version that supplies TLSv1.2. That is, both `Ruby > 2.0.0` and `OpenSSL > 1.0.1c` are required. Then, run `bundle update` to update your dependencies.

*For legacy Ruby SDK (such that was packaged in `PP_Ruby_NVP_SDK.zip`), download [this SDK](https://github.com/paypal/TLS-update/blob/master/ruby/PP_Ruby_NVP_SDK.zip)*

To check Ruby, in a shell on your **production system**, run:

`$ ruby -r'net/HTTP' -e 'uri = URI("https://tlstest.paypal.com/"); puts Net::HTTP.get(uri)'`

- On success, `PayPal_Connection_OK` will be printed.
- On failure, a `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError` or `EOFError` will be thrown.

### Node.js

Node uses OpenSSL. TLSv1.2 requires OpenSSL 1.0.1c or higher.

To check Node, in a shell on your **production system**, run:

`$ node -e "var https = require('https'); https.get('https://tlstest.paypal.com/', function(res){ console.log(res.statusCode) });"`

- On success, 200 is printed.
- On failure, a network error is printed.

## Native Mobile Apps

### Android

TLSv1.2 was made default for client connections in API 20 (Android 4.4W "KitKat - wearable extensions"). 

All Android app developers will want to make sure their code and PayPal SDK provide explicit support for TLSv1.2. Apps should be tested on Android 4.1-4.4 (API 16-19) devices to verify correct implementation. 

After the TLSv1.2 upgrade, native app support for user devices older than API 16 (Android 4.1 "Jelly Bean") will not be available. Fortunately, as of May 2, 2016, [Google reports 4.3% of devices accessing the Play store are API 15 or earlier](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#Platform).

Users of the PayPal SDK should simply update to the latest version. Outside the SDK, we've provided [an example Android app](android/) to illustrate how to support TLSv1.2. 

#### PayPal SDK support

SDK | TLSv1.2 support version
--- | -------
[Android SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Android-SDK) | [2.13.0](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Android-SDK/releases)
[MPL](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/mobile/ht_mpl-itemPayment-Android/) | [1.5.6_49](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/tree/gh-pages/MPL)

### iOS

TLSv1.2 support was introduced in iOS 5. The [PayPal iOS SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK) requires iOS 7 or higher. Apps built since 2013 will likely not need any updates.

### Windows

PayPal has discontinued SDK support for native Windows Phone apps. The related backend services will be shut down soon. Please update to a web browser integration. We recommend [Braintree v.zero for JavaScript](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/javascript+dotnet/guides/client-sdk).
